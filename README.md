Appendix

The following table illustrates all the accompanying Files and their respective purposes:
The R Codes are splitted into several files to speed up our processing. Hence, it is recommended to run these R Codes (in Notebook format) in the following sequence. For ease of reference, R Markdown docs (in HTML) are also enclosed in the submission.
S/N	Category	Filename	Purpose	Input File	Output File
1	R Codes 	data_preparation.Rmd	Data Preparation		all_DP.rds
	R Codes 	analytics.Rmd	Data Analysis	all_DP.rds	
2	R Codes 	feature_engineering.Rmd	Feature Engineering	all_DP.rds	all_DP_FE.rds
3	R Codes 	Pre_Processing.Rmd	Data Pre Processing 	all_DP_FE.rds	train.rds
test.rds
4	R Codes 	regularized regression.Rmd	Regularized Regression
(cover both Ridge and Lasso)	train.rds
test.rds	ridge-sol.csv
5	R Codes 	random_forest.Rmd	Random Forest	train.rds
